# Data Analysis For Business -Final-Proj
## Basketball Analysis Project Summary

This project delved into basketball data analysis using the R programming language. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contained 53,949 observations across 49 basketball leagues. The focus was on player performance, including fouls, rebounds, draft picks, and additional player attributes. The project aimed to answer key questions about scoring trends, player positions, and changes in the NBA over time.

### Key Findings:

1. **Scoring Patterns in Non-American Leagues:**
   Analyzing the top 5 leagues revealed common factors correlated with high-scoring players. Metrics like rebounds, turnovers, and shooting percentages were crucial. Notably, European leagues placed higher importance on player height, possibly due to different gameplay dynamics.

2. **Position Prediction and Player Clustering:**
   By utilizing k-means clustering based on player statistics, an approximate 64% accuracy was achieved in predicting player positions (guards, wings, bigs). Notably, wings' positions were less defined, highlighting the complexity of player roles.

3. **Evolution of the NBA Over Time:**
   Studying 21 seasons of NBA data, it was found that offensive statistics didn't show significant positive trends despite rule changes. Defensive stats like blocks and steals decreased due to evolving gameplay rules. The most substantial change was the surge in 3-pointers made per game, indicating a shift in playing style.

### Future Exploration:

Future research could explore why height plays a pivotal role in European leagues and determine optimal height thresholds for clustering players. Despite some limitations, the project offered valuable insights into the NBA's historical evolution, clustering methods, and non-NBA basketball dynamics.
